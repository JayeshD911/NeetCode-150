# 1. Two Sum

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers and a target integer, find the indices of the two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice. The answer can be returned in any order. For specific examples and constraints, please refer to the problem description on {Link: LeetCode https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/}.

## Solutions

### 1. Hash Map Approach (Optimal)
This approach uses a hash map to store numbers and their indices for efficient lookups.

*   **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ - A single pass through the array.
*   **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ - Space used by the hash table.
